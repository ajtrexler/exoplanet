# Exoplanets: where should we go?

Presented below is a simple exploratory analysis of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue.  I map out all the systems in the database, look for a bit of structure in the data, and finally apply some simple rules to five features in the dataset to assess which exoplanets might be habitable.

Here's my [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/atrexler/d/mrisdal/open-exoplanet-catalogue/where-should-we-go-v2) on Kaggle with more description of each step of the code.
